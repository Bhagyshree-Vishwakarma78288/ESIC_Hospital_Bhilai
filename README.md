Project Summary: ESIC Hospital, Bhilai
I have worked on the ESIC Hospital project in Bhilai, with a primary focus on structural detailing and some aspects of architectural planning. This multi-story hospital building consists of a basement, ground floor, first, second, third, and fourth floors, along with a terrace and staircase design.

My major contribution was in structural detailing, ensuring the building's strength, stability, and compliance with safety standards. Key aspects of my work include:

Structural design and detailing, focusing on beams, columns, slabs, and foundations.
Load calculations and reinforcement planning for durability and safety.
Coordination with architectural elements to ensure structural feasibility.
Staircase and terrace design, considering accessibility and safety.
This project enhanced my expertise in structural engineering, especially in hospital infrastructure, where precision and safety are critical.
